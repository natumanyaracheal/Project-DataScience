# Project-DataScience: Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition

## Description
The project explains how obesity levels are estimated basing on eating habits and physical condition.Data is collected from individuls from
countries of Peru,Colombia and Mexico.

## Data
Two datasets were considered for this project and their have been provided;

### [Dataset 1](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)
- This dataset contains 2111 observations and 17 variables
- 
### [Dataset 2](https://data.world/sonalnew/obesity-prediction)
- This dataset contains 1000 observations and 5 variables.
- 
## Results
Two models were considered for this project ie Randomforest and XGBoost.Accuracy was used as a metric to measure the performance of these two models.
Initial models were fitted and hyperparameter tuning done for the two models.High levels of accuracy were obtained for the two models ie 95.7% and 95.2% 
for XGBoost and Randomforest respectively.
